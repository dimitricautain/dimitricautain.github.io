* (Re)create a student-led free Saturday school for secondary school students across London. Essentially using the model of the Saturday Club which was entirely student-led from curriculum design to teaching. It is a key part of embedding the university into the local London area.
* Fight for state funded, free university education, and against the privatisation of Student Finance and uncapped tuition fees.
* Improve communication about available Hardship Grants for students, including carers and international students. Make more grants available through allocation of resources from SOAS endowments’ revenue.
* Support the efforts to challenge the white curriculum and make the prescribed not good enough to simply have interesting optional courses in our last year.
* Support liberation part-time offers to organise any events and networks, and coordinate any campaign work with Equality and Liberation Co-President.
* SOAS must remove the £150 administration fee for payments in installments.
* Decolonising the curriculum is about making education at SOAS liberating and challenging, instead of boring and disengaging.
