* Every term organising a Student-Staff Open Forum for different campaigns and groups to come and present to the community the work they are doing.
* Working more closely with Academic Senate to get issues of concern to the SOAS community to be discussed by Academic Board and the Board of Trustees.
* Working with Student Reps and Democracy and Education to spread the culture of syndicates in departments; these are nonhierarchical forums which are spaces for unofficial and egalitarian discussions between all members of departments, both staff and students.
