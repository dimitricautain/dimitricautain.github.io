* Fight Brexit and the impact it is already having on our communities, especially those at the sharp edge of Brexit and borders. This includes standing up to xenophobia, islamophobia and racism in all its forms at SOAS.
* Organise know your rights workshops for migrant/international students regarding access to public services, immigration vulnerabilities, your rights to protest and be active.
* With the NUS International Students’ campaign, fight to bring back post-study visas for all non-UK students, as well as maintain the easier access for freedom of movement across the EU for UK-based students.
* Enhance the MFJ/NUS Sanctuary Campus pledge with input from other ‘no borders’ groups such as Unis Resist Border Controls. Then, pressure SOAS to sign up to the strengthened Sanctuary Campus pledge.
* What can trade unions do for you? Organise workshops for student-workers on what rights to work are, what joining a union can do for you and you can do for it;
* Support any solidarity work that is necessary to fight for better working conditions for students and colleagues working at or beyond SOAS.
* Support all no borders actions in the UK, including direct actions against everyday borders and immigration raids.
* Encourage student-led research into SOAS complicity with borders and militarisation via their investment policy; and revive the Divest from detention and borders campaign.
