title: Reclaim Space for Students
order: 2

* The JCR is getting more and more crowded as we increase student numbers; this means that student parents, students in wheelchairs, amongst others, will find it ever more difficult to make their space theirs. We need to have more student run space in order to welcome more and diverse student needs.
* This could happen by reviving the push for the SU to takeover the Staff Common Room, as well as book the Senate House study rooms and Atrium for society events and classes (i.e. music, dancing).
Create more of student-run libraries, where dissertations and ISPs are available for consultation. Student-run libraries are also more relaxed study spaces where you can eat, talk, and access books without going to the library.
* What is going to happen to Vernon Square? The SU should organise a student consultation on what should be done with such prime real estate close to SOAS main campus; possibly pushing for it to be turned into accommodation.
