* Full and unconditional support to the Justice For Cleaners campaign to end outsourcing at SOAS. Ending outsourcing would increase both the quantity and quality of part-time jobs available for students, especially in catering services.
* Full and unconditional support to the Fractionals For Fair Play campaign to end casualisation at SOAS and beyond. Acting in solidarity with Fractional staff means raising their concerns in all channels, as they many are students too. This also means support to individual activists in their departments, via student reps.
* Expanding the gains of the Education Beyond Borders so that more and better funded Sanctuary Scholarships are made available. Also, recognising the leading role and work of students in the whole project
* Improving the information available about scholarships for BME and working class students, as well as making these available for all non-UK students.
More and better accessibility to hardship grants; especially for working students during assessment and examination periods.
* A century of colonisation will not be brushed aside if SOAS doesn’t invest in its students. SOAS has huge endowments in the private sector (£31 million pounds): the interests from the endowments should be invested in more scholarships and grants
* Supporting the migrant-led struggle against outsourcing is central to economic decolonising and the fight against racial and gender exploitation on campus. It also hugely important beyond SOAS because it is inspiring workers in other institutions to fight the injustice of outsourcing.
