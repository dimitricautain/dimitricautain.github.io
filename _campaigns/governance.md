title: Making SU Governance More Approachable
order: 9
---
* Making Union General Meetings’ more accessible. Change from elected officers’ oral reports to written reports sent in beforehand. Institute Points of Information at the discretion of the Chair. Encourage liberation caucuses to submit or comment on motions.
* Transparency: Make a public calendar available of the different committee meetings that SU representatives are attending. Also reaching out to concerned students to get input or report back on certain managerial meetings.
* Participatory budgeting: allocating some of the SU budget through an accessible bidding process, open discussions and voting. This is part of decentralising and democratising how the SU supports student-led initiatives.
