* Support students to obtain the learning agreements they need according to any special learning differences they have. Ultimately, these agreements should be binding, but this will only come through a concerted effort to inform staff and student reps that these agreements are key to making education accessible at SOAS.
* Assessment reforms: There should be a move away from written-only forms of assessment. The School is pushing through a policy which requires written submissions for all forms of assessment. This is unacceptable. Diversification of assessment methods ranges from; choosing weightings of different assignments, group work, and many other ideas that could come through department-based student and staff open discussions.
* Staggering deadlines: From the perspective of students no two deadlines for major pieces of work should fall in the same week. If this is coordinated internally within departments/degree programmes this should be achievable even for joint honours students as well.
* Support students in their choices to go forth with course change processes linked to welfare (i.e. moving to part-time, taking a year off, deciding to go on year abroad).
* Host a biweekly drop-in session on ‘course changes and welfare’ for students to meet with the relevant SU elected officers and staff. These could also be experience sharing workshops, to hear ideas and best practices with regards to mitigating circumstances and course changes.
* Hold SOAS accountable to breaching its own policy on class sizes, because it undermines the educational value of tutorials.
