title: Clearer Personal, Academic, Welfare and Admin Support Information
order: 7
---
* Work with student reps and course convenors to improve the tutor allocation and welcoming system for new students. Especially by making sure tutors are present in the first introductory classes at the beginning of the first year.
* Produce a single guide or map to all the different forms of academic, welfare, administrative and emergency support available at SOAS.
* Make this guidance be the first information that pops up on SOAS computers when you log in.
* Work with IT and concerned services to make changes to the way information is presented in the Student Advice and Wellbeing emails. Why is it easier to read the commercialised Student News than the counselling drop-in sessions?
* Maintain an open-door policy, respond to emails even if it's not much, and provide information on how to contact someone from the SU if no one is in during the day.
