title: Better, Affordable Food

* The only way to encourage healthier eating, is making it more affordable and diverse; not everyone can or wants to have Hare Krishna, but a lack of means shouldn’t restrict you from having a choice.
* A key way of improving the affordability and diversity of food is creating a more conducive environment for feedback and co-decision making on what is served and how things are priced. It is unacceptable that there isn’t a range and diversity of food on offer that reflects and meets the needs of the student body.
* An essential element of this fight for better food and nutrition is supporting the worker-led struggle to end outsourcing in catering services. This would create an environment of solidarity and support so workers can speak up about their working conditions but also demanding management to improve quality of food they provide.
* Fighting for more ethical sourcing of food. Ethical sourcing includes treating the staff at SOAS with dignity, respect and bringing them in house. It would also mean better quality products and food.
* Creating a communal kitchen which students and staff could use to cook.
