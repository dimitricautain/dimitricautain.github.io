* Widen the SOAS Guarantor Scheme so that it is available to any and all students who need it, because they are non-UK residents, working class or with any other marginalised residency situation in London.
* Work with University of London Housing services to increase their offer of affordable accommodation for SOAS students; having only 7 houses for SOAS students is not good enough.
* Revive the Residents’ Council as a space for discussion and collective feedback about what needs to be improved in Sanctuary Student halls.
* Push SOAS to sign a binding agreement that no information will be shared with the Home Office without the informed consent of students using the SOAS Guarantor Scheme or living with Sanctuary Students.
* Organise workshops and experience sharing with the Radical Housing Network and squatters’ associations to explore alternative housing options / models / initiatives.
* Fight the Housing Act and gentrification more widely; support student-led initiatives like Food For Luca which are fighting for a more humane society by addressing problems of homelessness first-hand.
